          This is a <mark>Jekyll</mark> theme that I found on GitHub and tailored to my liking. This project is my first open source project which has allowed me to use what I've been learning in realtime. Hopefully it will be helpful for people to learn from as I learned from this myself.

          This is my second open source project which is a simple modern one page website that allows me to try to build something on my own without the use of tutorials.

          During my time at ITT Tech, I learned most of my key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to meet tight deadlines.

          I spent a lot of my time learning how to keep a healthy work life balance working 2 hours away from home in the oilfield and being able to travel back to school and be on time.

      I enjoy many other hobbies which include woodworking, auto mechanic, kayak bass fishing, trail biking,  grilling/smoking bbq, pc gaming, tinkering with Linux home lab, or practicing for typing speed when I'm not learning web development. Currently, I'm averaging 90 WPM at a relaxed typing speed. I have maxed out at 120 WPM and still working on improving.
