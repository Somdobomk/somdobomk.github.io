          This is a <mark>Jekyll</mark> theme that I found on GitHub and tailored it to my liking. This project has allowed me to use what I've been learning. It is my first open source project and hopefully it will be helpful for people as I learned from this myself.

          This is my second open source project which is a simple modern one page website that allowed me to try to build something on my own without the use of tutorials.

          During my time at ITT Tech I learned most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I enjoyed my time at university and learned a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my time learning how to keep a healthy work life balance working 2 hours away from home in the oilfield and being able to travel back to school and be on time.

      When I'm not sat at my desk learning web development I will be enjoying one of my many other hobbies which include woodworking, auto mechanic, kayak bass fishing, trail biking,  grilling/smoking bbq, pc gaming, tinkering with Linux home lab, or practicing for typing speed. Currently I have a max wpm of 120 and an avg of 90 when I'm not in a rush.
